# Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-rays

## Project Description
This project uses **machine learning** to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images. The model classifies images into two categories: **normal** and **pneumonia**. It leverages deep learning techniques to accurately identify pneumonia, making it a powerful tool for healthcare providers.

## Relevance of the Project
Pneumonia is a serious condition that requires fast diagnosis. This project **automates the detection of pneumonia** from chest X-ray images, aiding healthcare professionals in making quicker and more accurate diagnoses. By streamlining the diagnostic process, the model can improve **patient outcomes** and reduce the burden on healthcare systems, especially in **underserved areas**.

## Key Features:
- **Accurate Classification**: Identifies pneumonia vs. normal lung conditions.
- **Efficient**: Uses a **pre-trained model (VGG16)** to achieve high accuracy with minimal resources.
- **Scalable**: Can be easily integrated into healthcare workflows for fast, automated analysis.

## Skills Used:
- **Machine Learning**: Building and training models to recognize patterns.
- **Deep Learning**: Used **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image analysis.
- **Data Processing**: Resizing and normalizing images for model input.
- **Python**: Utilized libraries like **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for development.

## Results
The model achieved the following performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**: 96.0%
- **Precision**: 94.23%
- **Recall**: 98.0%
- **F1-Score**: 96.08%

These results highlight the modelâ€™s strong ability to **detect pneumonia** with high accuracy, demonstrating its potential to support medical professionals in diagnosing patients efficiently.
